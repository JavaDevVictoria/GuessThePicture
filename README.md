# GuessThePicture

"Guess the painting" game. I'll leave you to work it out.

- There are 3 very famous paintings inside 3 files (one image per file. index, index2, index3) 
- If you are stuck you can click the hint button for the artist's name, then google image it and decide which one 

it is.
- Don't cheat by looking in the imgs folder....(the name of the paintings are in the file name so you can check 

afterwards against them)
- Don't cheat by looking at the source code....
- Don't judge, I made it as quickly as I could.... It ain't pretty.


---!ONLY OPEN IN FIREFOX!--- (I haven't tested in other browsers and chrome was complaining about tainting the 

canvas)

Enjoy!
